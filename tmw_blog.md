It has recently come to my attention that the [William Lin fan-club](http://codeforces.com/ratings/organization/20327) is rising quickly through the rankings -- currently only 7 points away from beating Peking University in terms of rating!

![Woah](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/516125325219069954/651101944823283730/unknown.png)

To promote the growth of the fan-club (so that we can rise up even further and maybe even beat MIT), I am writing this blog post to spread awareness about both the existence of the organization and the greatness of William Lin.

## Reasons to join the fan-club

- You get to show your support for William Lin &mdash; the founder of the USACO Discord server and an overall great guy
- By joining, the fan-club's rating will rise so that we can defeat the capitalist organization known as Google
- If defeating capitalism isn't your thing, we can also defeat Chinese and Russian universities I guess
- [user:tmwilliamlin168]

- Surpassing established and respected academic institutions is fun
- Did I mention [user:tmwilliamlin168]?
